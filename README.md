# GroupProjLog

I've noticed working on a group project that my group commits get tracked a bit oddly on contributions.  

Sometimes they get tracked when the branch is ultimately merged. This leads to a bunch of commits getting lumped up on one day rather than being more evenly spread out as they happen.

Other times, I might be working on an option to demo, but if the group ultimately decided not to go with what's in the demo, none of the work gets tracked even though it helped the group decide which way they wanted to move forward.

This is an experiement just to track some of my own commits locally and see how that goes.
